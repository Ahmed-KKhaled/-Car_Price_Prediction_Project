# -Car_Price_Prediction_Project
Predicting car prices using linear regression in python 
# Car Price Prediction 🚗

This project uses *Linear Regression* to predict car prices based on different features like brand, model year, mileage, and engine size.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains car features such as:
- Car brand and model  
- Year of manufacture  
- Mileage  
- Engine power  
- Price  

Data was cleaned and processed using *Pandas* and *NumPy*.

## 🧠 Model
I used *Linear Regression* from scikit-learn to train and evaluate the model.

### Steps:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Encoding categorical variables  
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets  
4. Training the model  
5. Evaluating performance (R² score, RMSE)

## 📈 Results
The model achieved an R² score of *0.97*, showing a good prediction accuracy.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib
